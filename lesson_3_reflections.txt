When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: When I would like my repository accessible anywhere, and when I want to collaborate with other people to work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: There are changes that others made on the remote repository that you may not want to incorproate in your local repository yet.
