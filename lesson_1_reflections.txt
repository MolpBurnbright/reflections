Using diff to compare two versions of file helps reduce the time it would take to spot a bug since diff would just show the lines of codes that have changed and thus it doesnt
need to go thru every line to spot the differences and bug.

using version control can make you a more efficient programmer since you wouldnt need to manually store versions for back up copies. It woudl also be easier to store back ups 
version control.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans. Git is intented to be used as software repository where multiple related changes can be committed at the same time (e.g. changes related to specific functionality).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans. By using 'git log' to view all 'commits', then usinng 'git diff' to compare two consecutive commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Ans. Using version control lets you revert back to previous version of codes thus giving confidence the working code can be recovered when something is broken.
